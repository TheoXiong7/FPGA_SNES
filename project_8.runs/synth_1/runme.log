CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-1056] Clock 'clk_100' completely overrides clock 'CLK_100M'.

Resolution: Review the constraint files and remove the redundant clock definition(s). If the clock constraints are not saved in a file, you can first save the constraints to an XDC file and reload the design once the constraints have been corrected.
